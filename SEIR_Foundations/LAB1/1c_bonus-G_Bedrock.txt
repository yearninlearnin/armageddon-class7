Bedrock-powered “auto-IR” pipeline for advanced students who can actually build and demo.

The pattern below is what real orgs do: alarm → evidence collection → LLM summarization → report artifact → notify.
This will be given to you

1) Incident report template (structured, consistent, gradeable)
2) Integration framework (AWS architecture + flow)
3) Terraform skeleton resources (Chewbacca naming)
4) Lambda handler skeleton (Python) that:
    pulls alarm context
    runs CloudWatch Logs Insights queries (WAF + app)
    pulls known-good values from SSM + Secrets
    calls Bedrock Runtime InvokeModel 
    writes report to S3
    notifies via SNS
Prompt pack (so reports are high signal, not vibes)

1) Auto-generated Incident Report Template (Markdown)
You must output exact headings (easy to implement).

2) Integration Framework (Bedrock “Auto-IR”)
Event-driven flow
    1) CloudWatch Alarm goes to ALARM
    2) Alarm triggers SNS topic (you already have this)
    3) SNS triggers a Lambda “IncidentReporter”
    4) Lambda:
        Pulls alarm metadata from event payload
        Runs Logs Insights queries via StartQuery/GetQueryResults 
        Fetches config from SSM and Secrets Manager
        Calls Bedrock Runtime to generate the report 
        Writes Markdown + JSON evidence bundle to S3
        Publishes a “Report Ready” message to SNS (link to S3 object)

Two modes (advanced students can implement both)
    Mode A: “Fast report” (15-min window, small evidence)
    Mode B: “Deep report” (60-min window + WAF correlation + top URIs + error clustering)

Optional extra-credit: use Bedrock Agents + Knowledge Base to ingest your runbook and “recommend steps.”
