EC2 Web App → RDS (MySQL) “Notes” App
Goal

Deploy a simple web app on an EC2 instance that can:
  Insert a note into RDS MySQL
  List notes from the database

Requirements
  RDS MySQL instance in a private subnet (or publicly accessible if you want ultra-simple)
  EC2 instance running a Python Flask app
  Security groups allowing EC2 → RDS on port 3306
  Credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager (recommended) or plain env vars (simpler)

Part 1 — Create RDS MySQL
  Option A (recommended, still simple): RDS private + EC2 public
    RDS Console → Create database
    Engine: MySQL
    Template: Free tier (or Dev/Test)
    DB instance identifier: lab-mysql
    Master username: admin
    Password: generate or set (keep it safe)
    Connectivity
    VPC: default (or class VPC)
    Public access: No
    VPC security group: create new sg-rds-lab
    Create DB

Security group for RDS (sg-rds-lab): This is the key “real-world” security pattern: allow DB access only from the app server’s SG.
  Inbound
    MySQL/Aurora (TCP 3306) Source = sg-ec2-lab (we’ll create that next)
Outbound
    default allow-all is fine: Don't touch this or Chewbacca will touch you.

Part 2 — Launch EC2
  1) EC2 Console → Launch instance
  2) Name: lab-ec2-app
  3) AMI: Amazon Linux 2023
  4) Instance type: t3.micro (or t2.micro)
  5) Key pair: choose/create (only if you want SSH access)
  6) Network: same VPC as RDS
  7) Security group: create sg-ec2-lab

Security group for EC2 (sg-ec2-lab)
  Inbound
    HTTP TCP 80 from 0.0.0.0/0 (so they can test in browser)
    (Optional) SSH TCP 22 from your IP only

  Outbound
    allow-all (default)

Now go back to RDS SG inbound rule
Set Source = sg-ec2-lab for TCP 3306.

Part 3 — Store DB creds (Secrets Manager)
  1) Secrets Manager → Store a new secret
  2) Secret type: Credentials for RDS database
  3) Username/password: admin + your password
  4) Select your RDS instance lab-mysql
  5) Secret name: lab/rds/mysql

Create an IAM Role for EC2 to read the secret
  1) IAM → Roles → Create role
  2) Trusted entity: EC2
  3) Add permission policy (tightest good enough for lab):
      SecretsManagerReadWrite is too broad (but easy).
      Better: create a small inline policy like below.

Inline policy (recommended)
Replace <REGION>, <ACCOUNT_ID>, and secret name if different:
#Check inline_policy.json in this folder 

  4) Attach role to EC2:
      EC2 → Instance → Actions → Security → Modify IAM role → select your role

Part 4 — Bootstrap the EC2 app (User Data)
In EC2 launch, you can paste this in User data (or run manually after SSH).
Important: Replace SECRET_ID if you used a different name.
#user.data.sh

Part 5 — Test
  1) In RDS console, copy the endpoint (you won’t paste it into app because Secrets Manager provides host)
  2) Open browser:
      http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/init
      http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/add?note=first_note
      http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/list
  If /init hangs or errors, it’s almost always:
    RDS SG inbound not allowing from EC2 SG on 3306
    RDS not in same VPC/subnets routing-wise
    EC2 role missing secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
    Secret doesn’t contain host / username / password fields (fix by storing as “Credentials for RDS database”)

Student Deliverables:
1) Screenshot of:
  RDS SG inbound rule using source = sg-ec2-lab
  EC2 role attached
  /list output showing at least 3 notes

2) Short answers:
  A) Why is DB inbound source restricted to the EC2 security group?
  B) What port does MySQL use?
  C) Why is Secrets Manager better than storing creds in code/user-data?
