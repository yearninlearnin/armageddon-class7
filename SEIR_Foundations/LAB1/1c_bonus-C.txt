Below is the Route53 add-on for Bonus-B (Hosted Zone + ACM DNS validation records + app.chewbacca-growl.com ALIAS → ALB).
It’s written as a Terraform skeleton with Chewbacca comment style.

Add this as bonus_b_route53.tf.

Add to variables.tf (append)
variable "manage_route53_in_terraform" {
  description = "If true, create/manage Route53 hosted zone + records in Terraform."
  type        = bool
  default     = true
}

variable "route53_hosted_zone_id" {
  description = "If manage_route53_in_terraform=false, provide existing Hosted Zone ID for domain."
  type        = string
  default     = ""
}

Add file: bonus_b_route53.tf
